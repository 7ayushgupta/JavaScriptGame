# Student Search (IITK) - BASH

Coded this up just to learn the basic commands of BASH.
* Fixed up the Automation Office, IITK links, which have been changed, and made most of the Student Searches useless for now
* Added a flags feature, by making use of `getopts` command in BASH.
* Currently works only for B.Tech students, as I have implemented it on a roll number wise basis.

To run:

Download the two files

Run `Scrape.sh`

Run `StudentSearch.sh` with the proper flags.
